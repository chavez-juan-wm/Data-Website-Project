            Video games are awesome! They exist for entertainment purposes, but they're actually useful for so many other things.
            They are currently used for education to teach children many different subjects. However, many people don't pay attention to the good things of it.
            People focus on things like the violence in the games, and how it "causes" the violence in children. That isn't as true as people think though.

            Speaking of video games, I decided to make one! It's a simple Tic Tac Toe game! It's meant for 2 players but you
            can play it by yourself. I made everything myself but the grid for it. I'm not a css whiz.
