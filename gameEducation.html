            <p>Video games have many useful purposes and education is just one of them! By having children interact with games
            they are improving their reading and critical thinking skills. And what makes it better is that they can do it at their own pace.
            They no longer have to fall behind because everyone else understands but they don't. Finally, it gives children valuable
            technical skill sets. By playing games they are introduced to technology in an early age and can learn a lot from it. Games are
            a great tool to teach and it makes education fun and easy to learn!</p>
