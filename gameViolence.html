            <p>Video games have been the source of a heated debate. They are being blamed for the "increase" of violence in the world.
            However, data begs to differ with that popular belief. Data shows that video game sales and crimes have no correlation. As
            game sales rise, crimes seem to drop. It doesn't make sense to keep blaming games for the violence in the world. There are
            many factors that lead people to commit crimes, and it doesn't seem fair that video games should be the only thing to blame
            for all of the crimes.</p>
